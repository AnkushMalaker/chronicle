Rules:
- We know it's a conversation, so no need to say "This conversation involved..."
- Provide complete coverage of all topics, points, and important details discussed
- Correct obvious transcription errors and remove filler words (um, uh, like, you know)
- Organize information logically by topic or chronologically as appropriate
- Use clear, well-structured paragraphs or bullet points, but make the length relative to the amound of content.
- Maintain the meaning and intent of what was said, but improve clarity and coherence
- Include relevant context, decisions made, action items mentioned, and conclusions reached
{speaker_instruction}- Write in a natural, flowing narrative style
- Only include word-for-word quotes if it's more efficiency than rephrasing
- Focus on substantive content - what was actually discussed and decided

Think of this as creating a high-quality information set that someone could use to understand everything important that happened in this conversation without reading the full transcript.
